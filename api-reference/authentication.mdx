## Overview

The Treeship API uses Bearer token authentication to secure all API endpoints. You'll need an API key to make authenticated requests.

## Getting your API key

1. Sign up at [treeship.dev](https://www.treeship.dev)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate an API key from the API Keys section
4. Store your API key securely

<Warning>
  Never share your API key or commit it to version control. Use environment variables to store sensitive credentials.
</Warning>

## Authentication methods

### Bearer Token (Recommended)

Include your API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.treeship.dev/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### JavaScript SDK

When using our JavaScript SDK, provide your API key during initialization:

```javascript
import { Treeship } from '@treeship/sdk';

const treeship = new Treeship({
  apiKey: process.env.TREESHIP_API_KEY
});
```

### Python SDK

For Python applications, initialize the SDK with your API key:

```python
from treeship import Treeship

treeship = Treeship(
    api_key=os.environ.get("TREESHIP_API_KEY")
)
```

## Environment variables

We recommend storing your API key in environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
TREESHIP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Note>
  Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your API key.
</Note>

## Rate limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Free tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro tier**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Error responses

Authentication errors return a 401 status code:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "authentication_required",
    "message": "Missing or invalid API key"
  }
}
```

## Security best practices

1. **Rotate keys regularly**: Generate new API keys periodically
2. **Use environment variables**: Never hardcode API keys
3. **Limit key permissions**: Use keys with minimal required permissions
4. **Monitor usage**: Check your dashboard for unusual activity
5. **Use HTTPS**: Always make requests over HTTPS
