description: "Enable trustless transactions between AI agents with Zero-Knowledge proofs"
---

## Introduction

ZK Commerce represents a paradigm shift in how AI agents conduct transactions. By leveraging Zero-Knowledge proofs, agents can engage in commerce while maintaining privacy, ensuring compliance, and building trust without intermediaries.

<Note>
  ZK Commerce enables AI agents to prove transaction validity without revealing sensitive business logic or private data.
</Note>

## Why ZK Commerce Matters

Traditional AI agent transactions face several challenges:

- **Trust Issues**: How can you trust an autonomous agent?
- **Privacy Concerns**: Business logic and data exposure
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions
- **Verification Overhead**: Manual review and approval processes

ZK Commerce solves these through cryptographic guarantees.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Registration">
    AI agents register with cryptographic identities
    ```javascript
    const agent = await treeship.commerce.registerAgent({
      name: "PurchasingAgent",
      capabilities: ["procurement", "negotiation"],
      zkWallet: true
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transaction Initiation">
    Agents create privacy-preserving transaction requests
    ```javascript
    const transaction = await agent.createTransaction({
      type: "purchase_order",
      amount: 10000,
      currency: "USD",
      generateProof: true
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Proof Generation">
    Zero-Knowledge proofs validate transaction conditions
    ```javascript
    const proof = await transaction.generateComplianceProof({
      regulations: ["GDPR", "SOC2"],
      constraints: {
        maxAmount: 50000,
        allowedVendors: ["verified_list"]
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Atomic settlement with cryptographic guarantees
    ```javascript
    const result = await transaction.settle({
      proof: proof,
      escrowConditions: {
        deliveryConfirmation: true,
        qualityCheck: true
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

### B2B Procurement
AI agents autonomously purchase supplies while proving:
- Budget compliance without revealing limits
- Vendor authorization without exposing vendor lists
- Quality standards without revealing specifications

### Digital Services
Automated service provisioning with:
- Usage-based billing with privacy
- SLA compliance verification
- Automated dispute resolution

### Supply Chain
End-to-end supply chain transactions:
- Origin verification without route exposure
- Quality attestations without revealing methods
- Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions

## Integration Example

```javascript
import { Treeship } from '@treeship/sdk';

// Initialize ZK Commerce
const treeship = new Treeship({
  apiKey: process.env.TREESHIP_API_KEY
});

// Create a commerce-enabled agent
const procurementAgent = await treeship.commerce.createAgent({
  name: "SmartProcurement",
  wallet: {
    type: "zk-enabled",
    initialBalance: 100000
  },
  compliance: {
    frameworks: ["SOC2", "ISO27001"],
    jurisdictions: ["US", "EU"]
  }
});

// Execute a compliant transaction
const purchase = await procurementAgent.purchase({
  item: "cloud-compute-hours",
  quantity: 1000,
  maxPrice: 5000,
  
  // Privacy settings
  privacy: {
    hideVendor: true,
    hidePriceDetails: true,
    generateComplianceProof: true
  },
  
  // Smart contract conditions
  conditions: {
    delivery: "within_24_hours",
    quality: "99.9_uptime",
    escrow: true
  }
});

// Verify without seeing details
console.log("Transaction verified:", purchase.proof.isValid);
console.log("Compliance met:", purchase.compliance.passed);
```
