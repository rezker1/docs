## Get started in three steps

Add Zero-Knowledge verification to your AI agents and start building trustworthy autonomous systems.

### Step 1: Install the Treeship SDK

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Install via npm">
    Install the Treeship SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @treeship/sdk
    ```
    
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn add @treeship/sdk
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Install via pip (Python)">
    Install the Treeship SDK for Python:
    
    ```bash
    pip install treeship-sdk
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Initialize your first agent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API key">
    1. Sign up at [treeship.dev](https://www.treeship.dev)
    2. Generate your API key from the dashboard
    3. Set your environment variable:
    
    ```bash
    export TREESHIP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Create your first verified agent">
    Initialize a Treeship client and create your first verified AI agent:

    ```javascript
    import { Treeship } from '@treeship/sdk';

    const treeship = new Treeship({
      apiKey: process.env.TREESHIP_API_KEY
    });

    // Create a verified agent
    const agent = await treeship.agents.create({
      name: "MyFirstAgent",
      capabilities: ["text-generation", "data-analysis"],
      zkConfig: {
        enableProofs: true,
        preservePrivacy: true
      }
    });

    console.log("Agent created:", agent.id);
    ```

    <Tip>Your agent now has built-in Zero-Knowledge verification capabilities!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Generate your first proof

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Create a Zero-Knowledge proof">
    Generate a cryptographic proof of your agent's performance:

    ```javascript
    // Execute an agent task with proof generation
    const result = await treeship.agents.execute(agent.id, {
      task: "Analyze this data while preserving privacy",
      data: { /* your sensitive data */ },
      generateProof: true
    });

    // Verify the proof
    const verification = await treeship.proofs.verify(result.proofId);
    
    console.log("Proof verified:", verification.isValid);
    console.log("Performance score:", verification.metrics.accuracy);
    ```

    <Tip>The proof validates performance without exposing your private data!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
