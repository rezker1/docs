## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) are cryptographic methods that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

<Note>
  Think of it like proving you're over 21 to enter a bar without showing your actual birthdate or any other personal information.
</Note>

## Why ZK Proofs for AI Agents?

AI agents often process sensitive data and make critical decisions. Zero-Knowledge proofs enable:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Prove agent performance without exposing training data or proprietary algorithms
2. **Trust Without Transparency**: Verify agent behavior without revealing internal workings
3. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements while maintaining confidentiality
4. **Decentralization**: Enable trustless interactions between autonomous agents

## How Treeship Implements ZK Proofs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Registration">
    When you create an agent, Treeship generates a unique cryptographic identity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action Execution">
    As your agent performs tasks, Treeship creates cryptographic commitments
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proof Generation">
    Zero-Knowledge proofs are generated to verify performance without revealing data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification">
    Anyone can verify the proofs using the public verification key
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Types of Proofs

### zk-SNARKs
**Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge**

- ‚úÖ Very small proof size (~200 bytes)
- ‚úÖ Fast verification time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires trusted setup
- üöÄ Best for: High-frequency verification scenarios

### zk-STARKs
**Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge**

- ‚úÖ No trusted setup required
- ‚úÖ Post-quantum secure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Larger proof size (~45 KB)
- üöÄ Best for: Maximum security and transparency

## Real-World Example

```javascript
// Create an AI agent that analyzes medical data
const medicalAgent = await treeship.agents.create({
  name: "MedicalAnalyzer",
  capabilities: ["data-analysis"],
  zkConfig: {
    enableProofs: true,
    preservePrivacy: true,
    proofType: "zk-SNARK"
  }
});

// Analyze patient data without exposing it
const result = await treeship.agents.execute(medicalAgent.id, {
  task: "Analyze patient symptoms and suggest diagnosis",
  data: sensitivePatientData, // Never leaves your environment
  generateProof: true
});

// The proof can be shared publicly
console.log("Proof:", result.proof);
// Output: { 
//   proofData: "0x8f7d...", 
//   publicInputs: { accuracy: 0.97, completeness: true },
//   verificationKey: "0x2a3b..." 
// }

// Anyone can verify the analysis was done correctly
const verification = await treeship.proofs.verify(result.proofId);
console.log("Verified:", verification.isValid); // true
```
